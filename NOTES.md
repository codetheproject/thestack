# codora

This would allow us to write frontend in JSX and take advantage of all the React ecosystem while having the flexibility to continue in typescript for the backend or Rusr

```code
| - functions
    - rust server will be marked here and typescript too and they will be available to be called immediately from routes
| - routes
| - app
    - font
    - component
    - styles
package.json
Cargo.toml
codora.toml
<!-- Rust -->


#[server]
async fn get_user(ctx: Context) -> Result<()> {}

#[middleware]
async fn log(ctx: Context) -> Result<()> {}

async fn handler(migrator) -> Result<()> {
    migrator.exec("Run some sql here or code here").await?;
}

#[derive(schema, before_schema=handler)]
struct User {
    #[schema(nullable=true, other_configs)]
    name: String
}

#[derive(schema)]
struct Address {
    name: String,

    #[schema(owner=User, unique=true, unique_index=true)]
    user_id: String,
}

#[migrator]
async fn (migrator) -> Result<()> {
    Migrator::new()
        .schema::<User>()
        .migrator(migrator)
        .await?;
}

#[config]
async fn (ctx) -> Result<()> {
    Config::new()
        .matcher(Match("^/(api|user).*$"), vec![log, other_middleware])
        .matcher(Match("*"), log)
        .function(get_user)
        <!-- We will register Job handler and queue later, Other Provider needed -->
}


<!-- In the functions  dir we will have server like this -->
@schema
class User {
    public name: string = query()
}


type Data = {
    name: string;
}

export async function getUser() -> Result<Data> {
    Ok({ name: "West" } )
}

<!-- In the routes would be jsx that can call server function and action written in rust or typescript work similarly like nextjs -->
export function Page() {
    <!-- This would import the funtion throw typed file but in compile time we would switch it an api request that call the endpoint from the server -->
    let user = await getUser();

    return (
        <div>{user.name}</div>
    )
}
```

codora wouldn't stop here it would provide third party lib like payment, websocket an infra to make working with codora easily, then maybe we could have another framework that allow building
ML projects and data science in Javascript with Rust Backed

## Features

* Dashboard - manage orm, job, request execution
* Command to manage project and we could add it dynamically
* Track request execution and provide interface to be used by prometheus which we would intrgrate with the dashboard
* Queue system and User can add an adapter that forward it to external services
* Cron Framework

### Libraries

* Authentication and Authorization Lib

Certainly! Here's a **markdown-formatted list** highlighting features provided by frameworks like **.NET**, **Spring**, **Elixir (Phoenix)**, **Next.js**, and **Vercel**. This comparison will help identify areas where **Codora** can enhance its offerings:
